**Web system for automated monitoring of students in different universities in Burundi.**

The projet was built to offer the following solutions:

- Registration of persons who meet the registration criteria at the ministry level by granting them a registration number; 
- Verification of the matriculation number that the student presents at registration if it is recognized by the ministry at the level of universities; 
- Verification if the matriculation number is not registered in another university; 
- Give the number of students at the end of each year of those who passed or failed Give the Ministry the exact number of students enrolled in the various universities.
